# Spanish Shopping Adventure

Created by Katarina Pfeifer and Anna McCarter

## Elevator Pitch

Your lovely, Spanish grandmother gave you a shopping list for the party
you’re having tonight and you need to retrieve the items - the only problem is the list is in
Spanish! It’s time to put your basic Spanish vocab to the test. In order to buy the items,
you’ll need to enter the food store, clothing store, and party store and then drag the
correct items from the shelves into your basket. Once all the items on the three lists are
checked off, you’ll take everything back to your grandmother and the party can finally
start thanks to your excellent Spanish skills!

## Instructions

Drag the correct items into the basket to check off the items. Progress through
all three lists to complete the game.
